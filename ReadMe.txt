Hooks are somethings in which we can use state features without using class compoents.

The Effect hook lets you perform side effects in functional compoents.

Context provides a way to pass data through the compoent tree without having to pass props down mannually at every level.

useReducer is a hook that is used for state managemennt

It is alternative to useState

Difference ?

useCallback is a hook that will return a memorized version of he callback function that only changes if one of 
the dependencies has changed

It is useful when passing callback to optimized child compoents that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders.
